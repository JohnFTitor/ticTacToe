15/09/2021: Today I started this project. First setting a basic logic and trying to understand how I wanted things to work. I think I'm getting most of how the modular pattern works and it's indeed a very organized way of coding, still more to learn, but I liked it. Right now everything aside from the Game methods is in a non-accesible scope, so the adding function to the Gameboard array, as well as the player definition and display behaviour is controlled just by the game, making things more secure and avoiding the need to check for some conditions (Like the one I first set for the add movement to the gameboard array). I may get a special liking to this, but as I said, there's still even more to learn.
